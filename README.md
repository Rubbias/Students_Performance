# Students_Performance
### This analysis gives an insight on the factors affecting the students performance
### QUICK ANALYSIS : Male students outperform female students by 27%. Contrary to expectations, study hours don't correlate with performance, as failed students studied more. Regular class attendance positively impacts results, while note-taking and reading, though popular, have minimal effect. Surprisingly, listening in class shows no correlation with performance, and sports participation seems to hinder student success.
